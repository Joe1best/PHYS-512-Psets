# PHYS-512-Psets
My Assignment folder for PHYS 512. Number 1 is seperated into a pdf (part a) and derivation of part b) and Problem_1b (testing the optimal solution).

For Problem 3 for the first function to test, I cant seem to get why my integral routine gives answers in absolute value (arctan(x) function to integrate). 

This code requires at least Python 3. I made them all in jupyter Notebook, with the exception of integrate.py which is used in Question 4.
